# livepeer-truebit-bigchaindb
Prototyping collaboration between Livepeer, Truebit, and Bigchaindb

Currently the Livepeer system can interact with Truebit via a [prototype](https://github.com/livepeer/verification-truebit) that uses IPFS. The repo explores the possibility of using Bigchaindb as a solution for serving data - ensuring data availability in a POA setting.

Documentation and discussions are captured in [issues](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-truebit-bigchaindb/issues).
